# **Project 3: Windshield Wiper Subsystem**

Conor Fryer and Jake Ciocca

## **Description:**
In this project, we designed a comprehensive windshield wiper control system for a car to provide seamless functionality and user-centric behaviors. The ignition subsystem ensures the engine starts upon the driver's occupancy and ignition button push, lighting the Green LED (LD1) on the NUCLEO board, indicating the car is ready to start and the driver is in the car. Once the ignition button is pressed, the Green LED turns off, and the Blue LED (LD2) turns on, indicating the car is running. The engine remains running even if the driver exits the vehicle. The engine can be stopped by pushing and releasing the ignition button while the engine is running. The driver seat occupancy button is implemented on the breadboard and connected to D10 on the NUCLEO Board, while the ignition button is the USER button on the NUCLEO Board. A potentiometer on the breadboard is used to choose the windshield wiper mode, connected to the NUCLEO board's A0 pin, providing intuitive mode selection. Another potentiometer on the breadboard is used to control the LCD display's brightness, ensuring good visibility of what is being displayed. The LCD display on the breadboard is connected to the NUCLEO Board and will display the current mode the windshield wipers are in, giving clear visual feedback to the user. If the engine is running and a wiper mode is selected (HI, LO, INT, or OFF), the wipers operate accordingly with predefined parameters. The desired delay time for the INT mode is retrieved from the intermittent delay time selector. If the wiper mode selector is turned to OFF or the engine is turned off, ongoing wiper cycles are completed before returning the wipers to the 0-degree position, except in the INT mode where hesitations are maintained if ongoing. This system ensures efficient and intuitive control of windshield wiper operation, enhancing the overall driving experience and safety.


## **Code:**
As you can see, we modularized our code for better understandability and maintainability. Our project is split into 8 modules as follows:
1. car_system
   * This module appropriates the car system's needs by initializing the inputs and outputs as well as setting the desired behaviors of the overall system.
2. code
   * This module works with the user interface module and matrix keypad module to interpret the inputted sequence. 
3. display
   * This module sets up the LCD Display to output the correct messages.
4. engine
   * This module controls the engine, its setup, and outputs.
5. ignition
    * This module sets up the parameters needed to start the car and its correlating outputs.
6. matrix_keypad
    * This module codes the matrix keypad to work and the accepted values.
7. user_interface
    * This module controls and creates what the user sees and interacts with.
8. windshield_wipers
    * This module controls the windshield wipers and all its modes in the system.

All of these modules are then tied in to work together in the main.cpp file. 

## **Testing Results:**
### **Ignition Subsystem**

| Test                | Pass/Fail           | Comment             |
|:-------------------:|:-------------------:|:-------------------:|
| Start the engine (i.e., light the blue LED) while the driverâ€™s seat is occupied and when the ignition button is pushed and then released | Pass |  |
| Nothing happens when the ignition buttons is pressed when the driver isn't sitting down in the seat | Pass | |
| Engine light remains on even when driver is no longer sitting down in seat | Pass | |
| Pressing the ignition button while the engine is on deactivates the engine | Pass | |


### **Windshield Wiper Subsystem**
| Test                | Pass/Fail           | Comment             |
|:-------------------:|:-------------------:|:-------------------:|
| Engine running, and the user selects HI, LO, INT, or OFF, the wipers run the appropriate mode| Pass |  |
| Wipers can change delay time during already active delay period, not reseting the wipe delay to the new delay time | Pass |  |
| Engine can be turned off during high, low wipe cycles mid wipe | Fail | Not enough time was allotted to add this feature. Delay is hard coded into wiper system. |
